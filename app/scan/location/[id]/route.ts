/** Commented by Desmond @ 29-April-26
 * @file app/scan/location/[id]/route.ts
 * @description Public redirect handler for location QR code scans.
 * 
 * QR code encode: https://swinburne-assets.vercel.app/scan/location/G001
 * This route validates the location_id, then redirects to the correct page.
 * 
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLE (Static QR + Dynamic Redirect):
 *  - The QR sticker URL (/scan/location/G001) remains static, permanent and never changes.
 *  - If the admin UI route changes (e.g. /admin/location/rooms becoming /admin/rooms),
 *    only the redirect destination below changes - stickers are never reprinted
 *  - This route is PUBLIC (no auth required) so any phone camera can scan it.
 *    Auth is enforced on the destination page so user has to sign in before presented
 *    with the page.
 * 
 * Middleware note: /scan/* is added to PUBLIC_PATHS in proxy.ts
